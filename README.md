# Workout Tracker

## Summary
Single-page workout tracker built with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS. It lets you pick a user, choose a workout template, track sets/reps/weight, and use a rest timer. All state is in-memory (no backend or storage).

## Run locally
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Optional: serve the folder if you prefer a local server:
   - `python3 -m http.server`
   - Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
